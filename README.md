# AMC Stats

AMC Stats is a spur-of-the-moment project I created to help the Art of Problem Solving community aggregate the numerous attempts to compile a list of AMC / AIME / USA(J)MO indices.

Although Python shelve is not efficient for a large database in any manner, I felt using it was a quick way to implement a single-file database solution to host the scores.
